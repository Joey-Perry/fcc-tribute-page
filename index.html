            <p id="tribute-info">It is said Ignatius converted to Christianity
                at a young age. 
                Tradition identifies Ignatius, along with his friend Polycarp, 
                as disciples of John the Apostle. Later in his life, 
                Ignatius was chosen to serve as Bishop of Antioch; the fourth-century 
                Church historian Eusebius writes that Ignatius succeeded Evodius.
                Theodoret of Cyrrhus claimed that St. Peter himself left directions that 
                Ignatius be appointed to the episcopal see of Antioch.
                Ignatius called himself Theophorus (God Bearer). A tradition arose 
                that he was one of the children whom Jesus Christ took in his arms 
                and blessed.</br>
